# Density_estimation
Density estimation visualization and  performance evaluation.
I loaded the Iris data set from sklearn and splited the data set into training and testing parts. I picked 2 of the 4 features. I estimated and ploted the densities for the available classes using the  Gaussian Mixture Model and the  Kernel Density Estimation. For Kernel density estimation, tried “tophat” kernel and “gaussian” kernel. After, I used all the features and evaluate the classification performance for Gaussian Mixture Models and Kernel Density estimation approaches.
